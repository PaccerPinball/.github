# Paccer

This organisation hosts various repositories for our "Paccer" Pinball, a DIY (wood) project. We chose PacMan as the theme, hence the name.

The library and the projects are designed to run on an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) (tested on [Arduino Nano](http://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-nano) and [Arduino Uno](http://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-uno-rev3)).
